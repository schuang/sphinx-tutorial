# Sphinx tutorial

A simple tutorial to demonstrate commonly used features of Sphinx for
technical documentation.

Sphinx is an open-source documentation generator that converts one or
a set of text files written in reStructuredText format into a
beautiful web site (HTML), pdf, epub and other formats particularly
suitable for technical documentation. With extensions, Sphinx can use
markdown or Jupyter notebook files as input source. While there are
many themes or templates to choose from, many components in the
generated documentation (e.g. CSS, sidebars, headers and footers,
etc.) can be transparently customized.
